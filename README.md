# 💡📲 Highlighted - Your Knowledge Bank

Highlighted is a software application that allows you to save for later that awesome content you find on the web ⚡️

The idea was born from the countless hours browsing specifications, documentation, and APIs (🥵) whilst wishing there were a more efficient way of retrieving the key infos for easy later reference.

The project is made up of **two parts: a browser extension, and a web app.** The extension serves as a bridge between the web content the user would like to save and the main application, which houses the saved content for future access 🚀

The process is seamless and saves time and effort in finding and saving important information.

 - And, of course, the content you saved 😉

## 📲 Usage

The application is fairly easy to get up and running 🙌

 - Create an account on the web app ✔
 - Download the extension from the Chrome store and login (support for other browsers will be added in the future) ✔
