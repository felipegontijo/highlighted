# Highlighted - Your Knowledge Bank

Highlighted is a software application that allows users to save content they find on the web for later.

It is made up of **two key parts: a browser extension, and a web app.** The extension serves as a bridge between the web content the user would like to have saved and the main application, which houses the saved content for future reference.

For more in-depth information on this project, please refer to the [Design Specification](https://github.com/felipegontijo/highlighted/wiki/Software-Design-Specification)

## In Progress!

Important: this is **currently a work in progress** and has its first launch date scheduled for late April. Check back soon to see if it's already out :)

## How To

The application is fairly easy to get up and running:

 - Create an account on the web app;
 - Download the extension from the Chrome store and login (support for other browsers will be added in the future);
 - Highlight that awesome text you'd like to save for later and find it in your account!

## Tech Stack
