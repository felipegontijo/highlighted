# 💡📲 Highlighted - Your Knowledge Bank

Highlighted is a software application that allows you to save for later that awesome content you find on the web ⚡️

The idea was born from the countless hours browsing specifications, documentation, and APIs (🥵) whilst wishing there were a more efficient way of retrieving the key infos for easy later reference.

The project is made up of **two parts: a browser extension, and a web app.** The extension serves as a bridge between the web content the user would like to save and the main application, which houses the saved content for future access 🚀

The process is seamless and saves time and effort in finding and saving important information.

## 💯 Features

Upon the selection of the desired text, the application saves:

 - The title of the webpage it was highlighted from;
 - The URL of the page;
 - And, of course, the content you saved 😉

## 📲 Usage

The application is fairly easy to get up and running 🙌

 - Download the source code ✔
 - Install all packages dependencies including Angular, Node, Express, MongoDB and make sure you have an account with Mongo so you can have your own set of keys and your instance of the app. Also upload the browser extension into your Chromium-based browser so you can use it ✔
 - Run the application and navigate to the usual localhost to see it live 👌
 - Browse the web as usual, highlight any piece of text you find worthy of saving, and keep browsing ✔️

## 🔜 In Progress!

In the future, the idea is to have a more streamlined experience, adding features like account creation and storage of the notes. For now, however, you can still use the application by downloading it and running it yourself. Hey there is even a good thing to that: you own your data :)
